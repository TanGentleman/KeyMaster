# KeyMaster

Command your keyboard! Even while afk :D 

Check out the Docs folder for documentation without the clutter of the function bodies.

## Features
Powerful classes for:
- Listening to and logging keystrokes (keyLogger.py)
- Parsing, visualizing and working with the data (keyParser.py)
- Generating and simulating human-realistic keystrokes (keySimulator.py)
- Validating what it means to be an acceptable Keystroke or valid Log entry (validation.py)

## Running
- I've made some sample workflows for automation, you can run it using simulate.py alongside appropriate CLI arguments
- I typically use the MacOS shortcuts app to run the script with a hotkey
- Example use case: Paste using command-opt-v to simulates the typing of the clipboard contents (With custom speed or even personalized behavior)
